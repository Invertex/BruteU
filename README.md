<h1>BruteU</h1>
A simple and fast brute forcer for guessing the last 1-8 values of a key by comparing to a known SHA-1 of he full key.<br/>
You must already have the first part of the key to do get a match, of course.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can also be used to find any key that is only 8 bytes in length, if you know the SHA-1. Anything larger would take far too much time.
